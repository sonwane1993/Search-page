Title: Java Servlet Project - Implementing HTTP Redirect with sendRedirect()
Create a Java project that implements a custom URL shortening service using the sendRedirect() method. This project will allow users to convert long URLs into short, easy-to-share links.
URL Shortening: Users can input long URLs, and the application will generate a unique short URL for them.
Redirection: When users access the short URL, they are redirected to the original long URL using the sendRedirect() method.
Security: Ensure the security of the application by validating user inputs, preventing malicious redirections, and protecting user data.
doPost() Method: Implement the doPost() method within your servlet. This method will handle incoming HTTP POST requests. You can use this method to process form submissions or any other data sent from the client.
sendRedirect() Method: Integrate the sendRedirect() method within your doPost() method. This method is used to send an HTTP response to the client, instructing it to redirect to a different URL. You can use this for various purposes, such as redirecting to a different page within your application or to an external website.
Project Goals:
Gain a practical understanding of servlets and how they handle HTTP POST requests.
Learn how to use the sendRedirect() method for client-side redirection.
Create a functional web application in Eclipse.
Understand the flow of data between the client, servlet, and redirected resources.
Target Audience:
This project is suitable for Java developers who want to enhance their skills in web development using Java Servlets, Eclipse IDE, and client-side redirection techniques.
By completing this project, you will have a solid understanding of how to implement HTTP redirection using the sendRedirect() method in a Java Servlet-based web application, which is a fundamental concept in web development.
